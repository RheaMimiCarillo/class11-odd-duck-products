## Impressions:

**How did this go, overall?**

This lab felt like good practice. It felt like a culmination of what we've learned thus far in Code 201 with just a little bit of new stuff to spice things up.

**What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?**

An observation I had is that many of the problems I run into at this level have already been "solved". It's mostly a matter of googling and adapting to my use case.

**How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**

It took me about 6 hours to complete the project, thus far and I felt like that's about how long it would've taken before I started.
